# Python Variable Annotations

This project focuses on using type annotations in Python 3.7 to specify function signatures and variable types.

## Learning Objectives

- Type annotations in Python 3
- How to use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
- Duck typing
- How to validate your code with mypy

## Requirements

- Python 3.7
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- All files must be executable
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.5)
- All modules, classes, and functions must have documentation

## Tasks

- 0: Basic annotations - add
- 1: Basic annotations - concat
- 2: Basic annotations - floor
- 3: Basic annotations - to string
- 4: Define variables
- 5: Complex types - list of floats
- 6: Complex types - mixed list
- 7: Complex types - string and int/float to tuple
- 8: Complex types - functions
- 9: Duck type an iterable object
- 10: Duck typing - first element of a sequence (advanced)
- 11: More involved type annotations (advanced)
- 12: Type Checking (advanced)
