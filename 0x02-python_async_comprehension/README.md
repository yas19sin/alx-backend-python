# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

This project contains tasks for learning about asynchronous generators and comprehensions in Python.

## Tasks

* **0. Async Generator:** Write a coroutine `async_generator` that yields random numbers asynchronously.
* **1. Async Comprehensions:** Write a coroutine `async_comprehension` that collects random numbers using an async comprehension over `async_generator`.
* **2. Run time for four parallel comprehensions:** Write a coroutine `measure_runtime` that executes `async_comprehension` four times in parallel and measures the total runtime.
